## Decomposition

Decomposition refers to the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, simpler subproblems. The idea is to solve each subproblem independently 
and then combine the solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem. This allows for the creation of more efficient and manageable algorithms by 
reducing the complexity of the problem and making it easier to identify and solve individual parts. Equally, this makes your code more reusable as each function 
solves a smaller issue which may be relevant elsewhere.
